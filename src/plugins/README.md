# `plugins/`

Nuxt automatically reads the files in your `plugins` directory and loads them at the creation of the Vue application. You can use `.server` or `.client` suffix in the file name to load a plugin only on the server or client side.

Additional information about the usage of this directory can be found [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins).

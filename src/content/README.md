# `content/`

The [Nuxt Content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org) reads the `content` directory in your project and parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` and `.json` files to create a file-based CMS for your application.

Additional information about the usage of this directory can be found [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/content).

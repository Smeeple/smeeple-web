                        <li><strong>Other Information</strong> - Other Information is information that, by itself, does not individually identify you such as browser type, operating system, technical data, and usage.

                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Legal grounds for processing your personal data</h2>

                    <p>We rely on the following legal grounds to process your Personal Information:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent</strong> - We may use your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy subject to your consent. To withdraw your consent for any uses of Personal Information described above, please review the section titled "Privacy Rights, Choices, and Account Termination" or contact us at: <NuxtLink to="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</NuxtLink></li>

                        <li><strong>Performance of Services</strong> - We may need to collect and use your Personal Information to enter into and perform under an agreement with you.</li>

                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> - We may use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests, including but not limited to marketing, to provide our Services and to improve our Services and the content on our sites.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>6. What information we share</h2>

                    <p>We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties and the information disclosed is the minimum amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate business purpose. We do not share Personal Information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Smeeple except in the following circumstances:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong> - We may share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Smeeple when we have your consent to do so.</li>

                        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong> - We may disclose your Personal Information to our third-party service providers who perform various functions on our behalf, but Smeeple requires these third parties to agree in writing to safeguard your Personal Information appropriately and in accordance with the law.</li>

                        <li><strong>For External Services</strong> - We may, from time to time, outsource some or all of the operations of our business to third-party service providers. In such cases, it may be necessary for us to disclose your information to those service providers. In some cases, the service providers may collect information directly from you on our behalf. We restrict how such service providers may access, use and disclose your information. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These agents may have access to your information as needed to perform their functions, but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</li>

                        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong> - We may disclose any information about you when, in our opinion, such disclosure is necessary to prevent fraud or to comply with any statute, law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any order of any court of competent jurisdiction. We will share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Smeeple if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: enforce applicable terms of use/service, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Smeeple, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>

                        <li><strong>In a Transaction</strong> - As we continue to develop our business, we might sell, buy or merge with companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, data generally are included in the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy statement/policy (unless, of course, the person consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Smeeple or all of its assets are acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets.</li>

                        <li><strong>After Being Fully De-Identified, Incapable of Re-Identification</strong> - We may share aggregated, de-identified information publicly and with our partners to evaluate the effectiveness, value, and analytic trends of the Services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>7. How we protect your information</h2>

                    <p>We take steps to secure Personal Information through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against the risk of accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Internet, and where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>

                    <h2>8. Transparency, privacy rights and choices, and account termination</h2>

                    <p>Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. Subject to your specific use of the Services, your privacy rights include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transparency and the right to information</strong> - Through this policy we explain how we use and share your information.

                        <li><strong>Your right to access or delete the Personal Information we hold about you is not absolute</strong> - There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to some or all of the Personal Information that we hold about you.

If an individual believes that the Personal Information about him or her is incorrect, incomplete or outdated, he or she may request the revision or correction of that information.

If it is determined that Personal Information is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated, we will use reasonable efforts to revise it and, if necessary, use reasonable efforts to inform agents, service providers or other third parties, which were provided with inaccurate information, so records in their possession may be corrected or updated.</li>

                        <li><strong>Right to withdraw your consent at any time</strong> - When we process your Personal Information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

You may withdraw your consent by contacting us at: <NuxtLink to="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</NuxtLink>. Withdrawing consents may significantly limit your ability to use the Services.</li>

                        <li><strong>Right to object or opt-out at any time</strong> - You have the right to object at any time to receiving marketing or promotional materials from us by either following the opt-out instructions in commercial e-mails or by contacting us, as well as the right to object to any processing of your Personal Information or to participating in any program. We will consider any request you make to us, and provide a reply in a timely manner, according to our legal, ethical and contractual obligations. Some non-marketing communications are not subject to a general right to opt-out, such as communications about transactions and disclosures to comply with legal or ethical requirements.</li>

                        <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> - You have the right to data portability of your own personal data by contacting us. There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refrain from transmitting your Personal Information to certain recipients or may require additional documentation before transmitting your information.

In the event we cannot fulfill your data portability request or require additional information to do so, we will contact you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>9. Terminating your account</h2>

                    <p>You may terminate your account with us at any time through the account settings or emailing <NuxtLink to="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</NuxtLink> Terminating your account will revoke any applicable consents or opt-ins but will be subject to any data retention requirements as described below.</p>

                    <h2>10. Retention of collected information</h2>

                    <p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we will retain your Personal Information only for as long as we believe it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected (including for the purpose of meeting any legal, accounting or other reporting requirements or obligations). You may request that we delete the Personal Information about you that we hold, as described above.</p>

                    <h2>11. Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>

                    <p>Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with access to your Personal Information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it &ndash; unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our Services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting <NuxtLink to="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</NuxtLink>.</p>

                    <h2>12. Information on children</h2>

                    <p>The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. In compliance with laws, we will not intentionally collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete it. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 18 years of age whom you believe might have provided us with their Personal Information, please contact us to request that it be deleted.</p>

                    <h2>13. Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h2>

                    <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. If we receive a formal written complaint, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>

                    <h2>14. California user privacy rights</h2>

                    <p>For California residents: We may share your personal information with third parties and affiliated third parties (such as local, state and regional affiliates and affiliate alliances), some of which do not share the We name, for their direct marketing purposes. As these third parties and this category of affiliated third parties are considered an unaffiliated party under California law, you may opt-out of our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To opt out, please contact us as at <NuxtLink to="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</NuxtLink>.</p>

                    <p>We will continue to provide your information to local, state and regional affiliates and affiliate alliances identified in your membership application or account for the purpose of processing your membership in such affiliate and affiliate alliance programs.</p>

                    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020, gives California consumers enhanced rights with respect to their personal information that is collected by businesses. First, California consumers may opt out of having their personal information sold to other persons or parties. Second, they have a right to know:</p>

                    <ul class="list-alpha">
                        <li>what specific pieces of information a business has about the consumer;</li>

                        <li>categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer;</li>

                        <li>categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;</li>

                        <li>categories of personal information that the business sold or disclosed for a business purpose about the consumer;</li>

                        <li>categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</li>

                        <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In addition, California consumers can request that the personal information a business has collected about them be deleted from the business's systems and records. Company may be considered a covered business under the CCPA as it collects and processes the personal information of California consumers. This Privacy Policy provides the required notices to California consumers. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from providing discriminatory treatment to California consumers if they exercise their rights under the Act.</p>

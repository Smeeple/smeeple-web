                    <h2>1. General terms</h2>

                    <p>Smeeple provides this Site to customers seeking an instructor with expertise in a certain area ("Customer") and to experts seeking to provide such expertise ("Experts"). The terms "you" or "You" or "Customer" or "Customers" or "User" or "Users" shall refer to Customers, Experts or any person or entity who views, uses, accesses, or browses any content on, and/or creates, uploads, posts, sends, receives or stores content to the Site. These Terms are entered into by and between Smeeple and you, and you accept them by:</p>

                    <ul class="list-alpha">
                        <li>accessing or viewing the content of the Site;</li>

                        <li>contracting for session(s) with an Expert through the Site;</li>

                        <li>registering as an Expert or providing expert sessions through the Site;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>To the extent that anything in or associated with the Site is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms, the Terms shall control. Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

                    <p class="uppercase">Please read this agreement carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. This agreement contains a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.</p>

                    <h2>2. Privacy policy</h2>

                    <p>Please refer to the Smeeple Privacy Policy at <a href="/privacy-policy">www.smeeple.com/privacy-policy</a> for information on how Smeeple collects, uses and discloses information about you.</p>

                    <h2>3. Services</h2>

                    <p>The Site offers a marketplace for those seeking Experts to provide their expertise. As independent businesses engaged by Customers, Experts decide, are responsible for, and generally control the methods, materials, scheduling, frequency, duration and all other aspects of the sessions they provide.</p>

                    <p>Customers are responsible for selecting the right Expert for their needs. In making hiring decisions, Customers should review and investigate each Expert's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from other Customers.</p>

                    <p>Smeeple controls and operates the Site from various locations in the United States and makes no representation that this website is accessible in all locations. Smeeple services may not be available in your location, and available services may vary among locations. In addition, Smeeple will attempt to deliver all correspondence sent via the Site's messaging system. Smeeple does not, however, guarantee delivery of all messages.</p>

                    <p>To use the Site, you must obtain access to the internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content and pay any service fees or other costs associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the internet, including a computer and modem or other access device. If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Site only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

                    <h2>4. Virtual sessions</h2>

                    <ul class="list-alpha">
                        <li>Cameras. Your Video Expert has the option to (i) enable (A) the Video Expert-facing cameras and (B) your self-facing and/or world-facing cameras (in the case of (B), subject to your approval), so you may see the Video Expert and the Video Expert may see you via video and (ii) initiate recording the video of that chat session ("Video Recording"). By using our Video Services, you consent to the Video Recording of any chat session that you have via Video Services and you give your permission to Smeeple to use your likeness and voice in connection with such Video Recordings, and you release Smeeple and anyone acting under its authorization from any claims that any use of the Video Recordings as authorized herein violates any of your rights, including any rights of publicity or privacy. Smeeple may, in its discretion, make such Video Recordings available to you through the Services or otherwise.</li>

                        <li>Be careful and show respect. Video Experts and other Smeeple representatives should be treated with respect. We know that requesting service can be stressful, but if you or anyone interacting with us on your behalf are verbally abusive or threaten the safety, well-being, or property of our Video Experts or other representatives, we may terminate your access to the Services and any products or services you have purchased. Our Video Experts strive to place your safety first, but if at any time you are uncomfortable performing actions suggested by a Video Expert, you should stop and communicate this to the Video Expert.</li>

                        <li>Disclaimer. Smeeple makes no representations and provides no warranties or guarantees regarding the quality, legality, suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of any Video Services or information provided through the Video Services. You are responsible for your compliance with applicable laws.</li>

                        <li>Video Content. You are solely responsible for your use of the Video Services, and you agree that your use of your device's camera to capture video and/or images shall comply with the requirements for Contributions described in Section 4.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to applicable law and the terms of our Privacy Policy, all images, artwork, technology and other content, data, meta-data, information, materials and other items recorded, streamed, provided or made available by you to Smeeple through your access and use of the Video Services, and all information and materials derived from or based on the foregoing, shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Smeeple.</li>

                        <li>Impermissible Use and Sharing. You may not use, or attempt to use, the Video Services through any means not explicitly and intentionally made available, provided or intended with respect to the Video Services (including, but not limited to, attempting to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Video Services or any other systems connected to the Video Services). You may not use or access the Video Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Video Services or that could interfere with the rights of or otherwise harm Smeeple. To the extent permitted by Smeeple, you may use and share Video Recordings with local pros in connection with your home repair or maintenance. Any other reproduction or distribution, and any commercial use, of Video Recordings is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    </ul>

You shall not use the Site to inquire about, engage in or aid or assist anyone with any form of academic dishonesty (for example, completing assignments or projects, writing papers or essays, taking (or helping to take) quizzes or examinations on someone's behalf), or to take any action that would violate the academic or conduct policies of a school, university, academic institution or workplace.</p>

                    <h2>14. Copyright infringement</h2>

                    <p>Smeeple respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users to do the same. Accordingly, Users may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way any content of Smeeple on the Site that is copyrighted material you do not own or have permission to use, without obtaining prior written consent of the copyright owner. Smeeple reserves the right, in its discretion, to remove any content on the Site if we believe it may infringe the copyright rights of others, and/or to terminate the accounts of Users who we believe to be infringers.</p>

                    <p>If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, we will respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), a federal law that provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that content or material hosted on the Site infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Smeeple a notice requesting that the content or material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>

                    <ul class="list-alpha">
                        <li>a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>

                        <li>identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>

                        <li>identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Smeeple to locate the content or material within the Site;</li>

                        <li>the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party;</li>

                        <li>a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the content or material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>

                        <li>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright" target="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a> for details. Smeeple's agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached at <a href="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</a>.</p>

                    <p class="uppercase">Under federal law, if you knowingly misrepresent that online material is infringing, you may be subject to criminal prosecution for perjury and civil penalties, including monetary damages, court costs, and attorneys' fees.</p>

                    <p>Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying Smeeple that your copyrighted material has been infringed. The preceding requirements are intended to comply with Smeeple's rights and obligations under the DMCA, including 17 U.S.C. §512(c), but do not constitute legal advice. It may be advisable to contact an attorney regarding your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Smeeple has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, Users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Smeeple may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Site and/or terminate the accounts of any Users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

                    <p class="uppercase">You understand and agree that Smeeple has no control over the acts or omissions of any User on or off the Site and that Smeeple makes no representations or warranties about the quality of the services provided by any User. You understand and agree that Smeeple is not responsible for the performance or conduct, whether on or off the Site, of any User. As such, Smeeple expressly disclaims, and each User expressly releases Smeeple from, any and all liability whatsoever for any controversies, claims, suits, injuries and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to the Site, including without limitation any acts and/or omissions of Users on or off the Site.</p>

                    <p class="uppercase">Users of the Site transact between themselves. Smeeple will not be involved in any User interactions. Smeeple is not responsible for disputes, claims, loss, injury, or damage of any kind that might arise during and after User interaction.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="uppercase">These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you. In no event shall Smeeple's total liability to you for all damages, losses and causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including but not limited to, negligence) or otherwise, exceed:</p>

                    <ul class="uppercase">

                    <h2>18. Assumption of risk</h2>

                    <p>Users assume all risks when using the Site, including without limitation any and all of the risks associated with any online or offline interactions with other Users. Users shall take all necessary precautions when interacting with other Users.</p>

                    <h2>19. Indemnification</h2>

                    <p>Users shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Smeeple and its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, other partners, employees, and representatives from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, expenses, damages and/or liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by Smeeple in any way related to your:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Users must cooperate as requested by Smeeple in the defense of such claims. Smeeple reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by Users, and you shall not, in any event, settle any claim or matter on behalf of Smeeple without the written consent of Smeeple.</p>

                    <h2>20. Arbitration</h2>

                    <p><span class="uppercase">Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from</span> Smeeple. For any dispute with Smeeple, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Smeeple has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, by binding arbitration administered by the american arbitration association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be st. Mary's county, maryland. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of Smeeple and expert. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing Smeeple from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.</p>

                    <h2>21. Injunction</h2>

                    <p>Notwithstanding Section 21, Users agree that any material breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Smeeple for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Smeeple reserves the right to seek equitable relief through the court system, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Smeeple seeks such an injunction.</p>

                    <h2>22. Notices; modification and termination of services; amendment of terms</h2>

                    <p>Smeeple may provide notice to Users via email, regular mail, or posting notices or links to notices on the Site. Smeeple reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend or terminate the services (or any part thereof), and/or use of or access to them, with or without notice. Smeeple may also delete, or bar access to or use of, all related information and files. Smeeple will not be liable to Users or any third-party for any modification, suspension, or termination of service, or loss of related information. Smeeple may amend these Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this Site. Your continued use of the Site following such update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to any of these Terms or to any future terms in a future revision of this Agreement, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Site.</p>

                    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Smeeple shall not make any material change to the Terms that relate to the collection or use of Customer data without first giving notice to the school or parent and providing a choice before the Customer data is used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.</p>

                    <h2>23. Governing law; waivers</h2>

                    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws, without regard to choice-of-law rules, of the State of Delaware. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in [Lusby, Maryland] for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in Section 21 (Arbitration), including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that St. Mary's, Maryland is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if Section 21 (Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable.</p>

                    <p class="uppercase">With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and smeeple are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.</p>

                    <h2>24. Physical activity</h2>

                    <p>Through the Platform, Experts may offer informative and/or educational services relating to physical activities. You should consider the risks and dangers involved in these activities and consult with your physician or a medical professional before engaging in any such activities. If you have, or if your family has, a history of medical conditions that may be impacted by exercise (e.g., heart disease, high blood pressure), you should not engage in such activities. The services provided by Experts through the Platform do not constitute, and should not be taken to be, the practice of medicine or that of a healthcare professional.</p>

                    <h2>25. Payment</h2>

                    <p>Smeeple does not process payments or handle User funds ("Fees"). Rather, the Platform provides for Fees to be made from Consumers to Experts ("Payments") through our payment processing partner, Stripe. Therefore, Consumers must review, accept and agree to be bound by the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/ssa" target="_blank">Stripe Services Agreement</a>, and any other related terms and conditions provided by Stripe. Experts must review, accept, and agree to be bound by the <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a> and any other related terms and conditions provided by Stripe. By using the Platform, Consumers authorize Stripe to charge your credit/debit card, bank account or other payment method for Sessions purchased on the Platform. By using the Platform, Experts authorize Stripe to charge or disburse Fees to your bank account or other payment method for Sessions provided through the Platform. It is a Users obligation to keep Consumer payment or Expert disbursement information up to date, and the Company will not be responsible for any delays in payment resulting from your failure to do so.</p>

                    <p>Should any disputes arise regarding payments made by Consumers or earned by Experts in connection with Platform, you agree to the following dispute resolution procedure. You may initiate a dispute in the Platform, or may submit any payment dispute by email to <a href="mailto:support@smeeple.com">support@smeeple.com</a>. This includes all disputes relating to alleged charges and/or payment errors, refund requests, and any other disputes relating to payments by Consumers or earnings and disbursements to Experts. The Company will endeavor to review your claim and provide a written determination within thirty (30) days of receipt, unless otherwise required by law. Our review will be based on these Terms and the Stripe Services Agreement. For Consumers, we will attempt to cause Stripe to pay you any disputed amounts we determine you are owed using the method with which you made the disputed payment, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so if your payment method information is inaccurate, incomplete, or has been cancelled. If as a Consumer you close or deactivate your account before we reach a final resolution of your claim, we will not be able to issue you any amounts you are owed and are not responsible for any resulting delays or non-payment. For Experts, we will attempt to cause Stripe to pay you any disputed amounts we determine you are owed using bank account or other disbursement information you provided to Stripe.</p>

                    <h2>26. Entire agreement</h2>

                    <p>These Terms (including, solely as to Experts, the Expert Instructor Agreement entered into by the applicable Expert) constitute the entire agreement between you and Smeeple relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the Site or third-party products or services. If any term in the Expert Instructor Agreement conflicts with a term in these Terms, the Expert Instructor Agreement shall control.</p>

                        <li><strong>Benefits</strong> - Expert acknowledges that Expert is engaged in an independent business, and as such, Expert is not (and shall at no time become) eligible to participate in any pension, health, or other benefits plan of Smeeple.</li>

                        <li><strong>Insurance</strong> - No Workers' Compensation Insurance shall be obtained by Smeeple for or on behalf of Expert.

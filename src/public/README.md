# `public/`

The `public` directory is directly served at server root and contains public files that have to keep their names (e.g. `robots.txt`) or likely won't change (e.g. `favicon.ico`).

Additional information about the usage of this directory can be found [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public).
